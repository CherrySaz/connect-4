# About my project

Welcome to my Connect 4 game. This is a fun strategy game created using Python and has been built in the terminal. It is a Player vs Player game, with the option to play against the computer if required. 
As a small child, Connect 4 was a family favourite, which gave me my inspiration for my project.

# Some history about  the game

The game was originally released under a company called 'Score Four' until in 1968, it was bought by a company called 'Funtastic'.
The more modern version of the game was created by 2 business partners, 'Howard Wexler', a toy inventor, and 'Ned Strongin'.
The game was licensed in 1974 by Milton Bradley, which was later purchased by a toy company that is still going strong today, Hasbro.
In 1988, Connect 4 was solved for the first time. Today, there are various different sizes of the game. There's a household version, a travel version, even a giant garden version so you can play it outside in the warmer months.There are even giant versions of Connect 4 in pub gardens and play areas around the Country, which just shows its popularity!

## Game History


## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
